         <p><h1>The Seven Wonders of The World</h1>
            <br>
          Our world is filled with the most unique structures that are both
          man-made and natural. Some of the man-made creations include churches,
          tombs, temples, monuments, mosques, buildings and even cities. These
          structures have withstood the test of time and they continue to leave
          many awestruck with their brilliance. There are many in the world, but
          only seven are selected, which are deemed to be the best.
        </p>
        <p>
          At present, as chosen by the New7Wonders Foundation, the Seven Wonders
          of the World are the Taj Mahal, the Colosseum, the Chichen Itza, Machu
          Picchu, Christ the Redeemer, Petra, and the Great Wall of China. Added
          to the list is the Great Pyramid of Giza, though it is just considered
          an honorary candidate and not a wonder of the world.
